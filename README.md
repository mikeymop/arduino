# Arduino Sketches

This repository is a collection of simple Arduino sketches I experimented with.
These may or may not be used anywhere.

### Boards I Use:

#### [NodeMCU (ESP-12E)](https://www.seeedstudio.com/NodeMCU-v2-Lua-based-ESP8266-development-kit-p-2415.html)
![NodeMCU Pinout](https://pradeepsinghblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/nodemcu_pins.png)

### MQTT Protocol

MQTT is an IoT protocol that lets you transmit simple messages over IP to a host which can act on that data.

#### Not my fault

This is where I waive my responsibility for any way you can mess up your hardware using my code.
